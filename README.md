# PowerMock_Kotlin_backtick_naming_bug
A project demonstrating a bug in PowerMock [#903](https://github.com/powermock/powermock/issues/903) where unit tests written in Kotlin will sometimes fail if they were named with Kotlin's backtick method syntax.

See full write-up in my Medium blog post: [Matt's Tidbits #32](TBD).
